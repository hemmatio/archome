          "We are blessed by finding Arc Home to renovation needs in our apartment. They did everything according to the agreement, even some extras all on time, and with no extra fees. We strongly recommend them to anyone looking for an honest, organized, and caring contractor."

          "We had our new house half done by a builder with plenty of issues ... We met the owner of Arc Home in the neighborhood not knowing that he was the treasure we needed. Tried him with a small project ... It was perfect. Then we asked him to take over other projects and fix the mess of my previous contractor as well. He did everything we asked with no issues. No extra costs, no delays."

                  "Esmail renovated 3 bathrooms for us. During all the renovations, with their thorough explanations, we realized what was important: how to make showers and bathrooms waterproof. He emphasized the materials under the tiles instead of just changing the surface tiles of the shower. After this, we realized how knowledgeable he was and how lucky we were to have a contractor like him. He is not only an expert but a kind man, he makes sure to give high-quality results that work best for your house. I am sure that these showers will last 50 years with the renovations done by him."

                 "We had our entire main floor renovated by Arc Home last summer. This included a suite, our kitchen, the living room, and the entrance. Esmail, the owner of Arc Home, recommended porcelain tiles and a waterproof structure underneath so nothing would leak. All of this was done in 2 weeks. He and his team were working nonstop for most of the day for us to get it done as soon as possible while not compromising quality. I will always recommend Esmail and his team. You will not regret working with him."
